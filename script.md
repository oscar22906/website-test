## slide 1
Whats up gang its me oscar taylor from your class and this is my presentation about my next steps
## slide 2
so a few of my skills are C#, unity, blender, im motivated, very intuitive and extremely patient
I am mostly interested in working on smaller to medium game, and i prefer indie games to triple A games. I tend to enjoy the creative aspects of games too rather than coding so i would rather develop skills like design, audio and storytelling
## slide 3
my greatest weaknesses
I am really terrible at deadlines and time management so I will have to improve that
working with large teams is probably scary and i get quite easily burnt out after completing a project
## slide 4
I dont really have any idea what my dream job would be because i havent done any work in video games yet.
 owning a publishing company would be kinda awesome sauce
 as for an entry level job I would like to do modeling and making assets because these offer lots of creative freedom
 ## slide 5
 Here are some of my options after college
 University is very expensive but it could be a good option just to get some more qualifications
 Apprenticeships are also a good option but it can be hard to get into one
 theres also the option of trying to join an online indie team but this will likely not pay anything
 ## slide 6
 slide number 6... portoflio
 I have been putting together a website to display the projects that I have done so far, this will show any employer what i have done and what they can expect from me. Visit www.freak.money NOW
 ## slide 7
 And finally the next game. my idea is for it to be a narrative driven simulation puzzle game. you play as an alien in a derelict spacecraft with radio equipment as your only connection to other life. This concept would allow me to focus on design, audio and narrative while being very technically simple.
